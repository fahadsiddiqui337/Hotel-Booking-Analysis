## Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project
The data that this project is based on are hotel ticket records from the City Hotel and the Resort Hotel. The project's aim is to look into what causes hotel reservations to be canceled and offer ideas and suggestions on how to lower cancellation rates and boost income.

## Project Steps
**Problem Statement:** Define the problem statement and objectives of the analysis.

**Data Identification:** Identify the dataset to be analyzed. In this project, the dataset used is "hotel_bookings.csv".

**Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Explore the dataset and perform necessary data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data types.

**Data Analysis:** Analyze the cleaned dataset to gain useful insights into the factors affecting hotel reservation cancellations. This may involve performing statistical analysis, data visualization, and applying machine learning techniques.

**Visualization and Reporting:** Present the analyzed data in the form of reports or dashboards using visualization tools such as matplotlib and seaborn. Generate visualizations that effectively communicate the findings and recommendations.

## Business Problem
Both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have been experiencing high cancellation rates, leading to decreased revenue and suboptimal room utilization. The primary goal of this analysis is to identify the factors contributing to reservation cancellations and provide actionable insights and recommendations to address this problem.

## Research Questions
. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?

. How can hotel reservation cancellations be improved?

. How can hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Hypotheses
. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.

. Customers tend to cancel more frequently when there is a longer waiting list.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used for this analysis:

pandas

matplotlib.pyplot

seaborn

warnings
